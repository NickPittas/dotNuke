Code dump for the VoxelRenderer blink script used in Nuke. Code is rough and with little commenting, but will hopefully be cleaned up and properly documented over time.

To add the nodes to nuke, add the "./plugin" directory to the nuke plugin path. This can be done by modifying NUKE_PATH or using `nuke.pluginAddPath()`.

Check "./demo_scene.nk" for an example of the nodes in use.
